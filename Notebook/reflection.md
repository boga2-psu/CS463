### Lab 1 - HTML
* __Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?__  
  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed the solutions on my own.
* __How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?__  
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercises were useful in cementing the topics of semantics of the basic objects in HTML. They were all helpful in their own ways.

* __Was there something that you wish had been explained better?__  
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, everything was very clear.
* __Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s
topic a little better?__  
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the lab went over all basic semantic elements without getting too complicated.
